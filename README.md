Alphabots is a word game in which you attempt to teach robots language.  It is played using only the mouse and your vocabulary.  There are three phases, the first allows you to collect resources by creating words from a collection of letters.  The second phase allows you to spend your earned resources in order to upgrade language injection units to teach the boss in phase 3.  In phase 3 you use the language injection units to teach a robot by locking in randomly generated letters into words.

Alphabots is built using Ember, Node, and Mongo.  It is coded primarily in javascript and utilizes both the Canvas element as well as heavy amounts of DOM manipulation.
